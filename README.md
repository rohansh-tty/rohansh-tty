## Hi, I'm Rohan

I'm a software dev by day, and a tinkerer by night! Currently, I'm building a local password vault using [Varden](https://github.com/rohansh-tty/varden) - it's a side project that's been keeping me up late, but I'm stoked to see it come together. 

I also passively contribute to Open-source projects, some of which include [Listmonk](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Arohansh-tty), [Rocketry](https://github.com/Miksus/rocketry/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arohansh-tty+is%3Aclosed), [FOSS United](https://github.com/fossunited/logo-generator) and [Hexmos](https://github.com/HexmosTech/Lama2Code/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Arohansh-tty).
